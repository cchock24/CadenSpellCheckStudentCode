Decided to try and use Binary Search for checking if word is in dictionary. Decided to use the binary search that I used in Spelling Bee |

Trying to make more efficient by turning the search to check if word is duplicate into binary search |

Then I realized to sort the data it would take even longer than if I were to just interate through the bad word list |
| Sep 26 |            10:15 - 10:45            | I talked to Alex during lunch about his approach to the problem set. He mentioned using a set, because it doesn't let you add duplicate elements, so I've just been reading through a bunch of websites on them. I'm curious to how they work it looks like it uses a hashing algorithm somewhere. When you add an element it checks to see if its already in the set if it is it removes it. It also doesn't have order. Things I still need to find out are 1) How does this thing work (What's is runtime) 2) Will it keep the order of the elements the same as when I add them |
| Sep 26 |             10:45-11:15             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Ok I found out that set doesn't keep track of order, and can apparently check in constant time so if I use a hashed set yay. So i made a seperate arraylist to keep track of the order of the element. The code worked, but when i compared its runtime to when I just used a for loop it was slower... |
| Sep 26 |             11:15-11:45             |                               Ok I realized, that the way I was adding to my arraylist was inefficient. I was using contains to see if it had the word in the set, but this resulted in an error when the same wrong word occured multiple times so I decided to look through the set method library and realized that add returns true if the element is being added for the first time, so I used that. I also learned that even thought the set code was slower for some of the problems like sentence, it was faster than the loop (a lot faster) when running the longer texts |
| Oct 2  | I accidentally ovewrote the time... |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Worked on the Trie. I think the dictionary try is being made correctly however, I don't the check trie fnc is working |

Also I thought the cleaned text files were supposed to only be letters and '. I was not expecting a Ã¹ :/. Fixed it and got the Tries to work :D. Starting to work on TST |
